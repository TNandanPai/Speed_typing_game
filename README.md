# Speed_typing_game

This is a web-based Speed Typing Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It allows users to test their typing speed, accuracy, and consistency in real time.

When the game starts, a random paragraph is displayed for the user to type.

The input field is hidden and automatically focused to enhance user experience.

The game tracks key metrics including WPM (Words Per Minute), CPM (Characters Per Minute), and the number of mistakes.

A countdown timer starts at 60 seconds, challenging users to type as fast and accurately as possible.

Typed characters are highlighted as correct or incorrect to provide immediate visual feedback.

At any time, the "Try Again" button resets the game with a new paragraph and refreshed stats.

The interface is responsive and visually appealing, featuring a clean dark theme with animations.

This project showcases my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time UI updates.
